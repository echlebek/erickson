# erickson
Erickson is a simple code review app. Code reviews are created via
the API methods, or the web frontend.

Once a review is created, annotations can be made to the diff, and
successive versions of the diff can be appended to the original review.

Erickson is a work in progress and many features are incomplete, missing
or broken.

Project goals:
* Dead-simple setup that doesn't require integration with other services.
* A simple, lightweight UI that requires minimal JS.
* A small feature-set that is robust and reliable.

TODO:
* Annotations
* Authentication
* TLS
* SCM-specific tools
